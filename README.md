## Files

- src: the file that implements de solution.

## Features
The main features of the application include:
- Enumeration of all possible 4-digit sequences.
- Identification of sequences with repeated elements.
- Extraction of sequences with identical four elements.
- Detection of sequences where two digits occur twice.
- Identification of sequences with one element repeated twice and the other two elements unique.
- Extraction of sequences where one element is repeated three times while the other element remains non-repeating.
- Verification process to ensure consistency between section counts.
